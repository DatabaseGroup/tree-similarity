/// Implements the LHJoin tree similarity join. First, a tree is converted into a 
/// label histogram. Second, a candidate index is used to retrieve candidates  
/// by applying the label histogram lower bound by Kailing et al. Next, the 
/// resulting tree pairs, called candidates, have to be verified. Last, the 
/// remaining candidates are evaluated by Touzets algorithm.
