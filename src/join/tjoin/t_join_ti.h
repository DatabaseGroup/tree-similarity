 * First, a tree is converted into a label set. Second, a candidate index is
 * used to retrieve candidates by looking up a node label inverted list and
 * applying the structural filter. Next, the resulting tree pairs, called
 * candidates, have to be verified. Therefore, the Label Guided Mapping upper
 * bound sends candidates to the result set without TED computation. Last,
 * the remaining candidates are verified. Currently best, linear-time Touzet's
 * algorithm should be used.
