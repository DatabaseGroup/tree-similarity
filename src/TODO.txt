General:
  - Directory structure
  - Makefile(s) according to directory structure
  - Use references where possible (no copying!)
  - Resolve memory leaks (valgrind, cppcheck)
    - Pass at least
      valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --track-origins

node:
  - Keep it as short as possible to minimize user effort for a custom node class
  - Change label_id to a string label (default node class)
