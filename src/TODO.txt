General:
  * Would a directory structure be useful? (I - Daniel - don't think so, since
    we only keep .h files)
  * CMake instead of current hand-crafted Makefile
  * Check reference/pointer usage (avoid copying as much as possible)
  * Check if memory leaks are resolved (and if not, resolve them)
    * Include check target in Makefile, to automatically invoke
      valgrind/cppcheck/splint

node:
  * Check if node class can be shortened (should be as short as possible to
    minimize the effort of users when creating 

zhang_shasha.h:
  * Documentation (check for completeness)

string_edit_distance.h:
  * Documentation (check for completeness)

upper_bound.h:
  * Template function instead of a class? (like in zhang_shasha.h)
