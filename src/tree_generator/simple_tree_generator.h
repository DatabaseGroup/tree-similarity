/// Implements a simple tree generator that doesn't produce a tree structure.
/// It generates a correct bracket notation representation of a tree of
/// a specific given size.
///
/// Additionally, the generated trees can be modified by given number of edits.
/// Random nodes can be deleted or renamed. Insertion is not implemented.
///
/// Based on https://frosch.cosy.sbg.ac.at/mpawlik/tree-generator
