# clean-doc-msc-kocher

This branch is supposed to replace the master branch at some point.

## Purpose

1. Clean up the repository (from the state of the `xml_parser` branch, i.e., the
final state of msc-kocher).
2. Add a meaningful documentation to all parts of the codebase.
3. Refactor parts of the codebase if necessary.
4. Enforce (and probably extend) the coding policy/style described on the `master`
branch.

This branch will **not** include the work of bsc-auinger as Tobias currently tries
to reimplement his part of the codebase (see `visualization` branch). This part
of the code will be added/merged when it is finalized.
